# Derik's Portfolio

By [Derik Strattan](http://www.derikstrattan.com).

## Description
**My personal portfolio** built in Rails 3.2.14, with Twitter Bootstrap and custom themes. This project has multiple branches, mostly for additional features or testing that I did not incorporate into the master. The site is hosted on Heroku, uses [New Relic](www.newrelic.com) for monitoring, and AWS Cloudfront to serve static assets.
